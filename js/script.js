/*  
This js mimics some of the user onboarding that I use on my Forum. This is very basic compared to
the full server side validation logic that a real site uses.

I did not code my forum, its a paid package that I've used for years. I do, however, customize 
certain scripts, php and html to my own needs, usually with success.  Similiar to how some folks use Wordpress.*/



const forumName = 'Talk and Stuff';
console.log(forumName)

let text = "Sign up now, the forum needs you!"
alert(text)
